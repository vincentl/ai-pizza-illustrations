# Neapolitan Style

Neapolitan pizza is a traditional Italian pizza known for its thin, soft, and
chewy crust with a slightly puffy, charred edge (cornicione). It features
simple, high-quality ingredients: crushed San Marzano tomatoes, fresh
mozzarella (often mozzarella di bufala), fresh basil, and a drizzle of olive
oil. Baked at very high temperatures—typically in a wood-fired oven—it cooks in
under 90 seconds, resulting in a tender, flavorful pizza with a slight droop at
the tip of each slice.

## Prompt

```txt
Create a square-format illustration of a single slice of Neapolitan pizza in
the style of a modern lithograph inspired by Katsushika Hokusai. 

The pizza slice should be viewed at a three-quarter angle, as if being held up
and the tip is drooping slightly downward. Emphasize the creamy, barely
off-white crust with subtle char speckles, vibrant red tomato sauce, soft pools
of melted mozzarella, and a fresh basil leaf on top. 

Use clean, expressive ink outlines with flat color fills and light
cross-hatching to evoke a pen-and-ink lithograph look. The background should be
a solid color: Pantone® 11-4101 TCX (approximately hex #F7F6F2). 

Add the label "Neapolitan" underneath in the Lora font. 

The overall feel should be elegant, slightly stylized, and suitable for
inclusion in a food styles poster.
